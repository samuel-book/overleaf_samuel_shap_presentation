We can model key changes to pathway:
\begin{small}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What if the pathway were faster?
    \item What if hospital determined the stroke onset time in more patients?
    \item What if clinical decision-making was like that of \emph{benchmark} hospitals? (Predict what treatment a patient would receive at other hospitals).
\end{itemize}
\end{small}
\footnotesize{We model these changes with a hospital's own patient population, to allow for inter-hospital variation in patient population characteristics.}
