    \item In order to compare decision-making between hospitals, we selected 10k patients (stratified by hospital and thrombolysis use) to keep in a hold-back dataset.

    \item We trained model using the remaining 78,928 patients. 
    
    \item By passing all of the 10k patients (that were held back from the training process) through the fitted model, whilst setting the hospital attended feature to each hospital in turn, we predicted the thrombolysis rate for each hospital if all hospitals saw the same patients, revealing the variation in thrombolysis that is caused by the hospital, rather than by between-hospital variation in patient populations.
