\begin{itemize}
    \item What is AI?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item AI (Artificial intelligence) is a 'catch-all' term for any method that \textit{appears} to mimic something we usually consider requiring human intelligence.
        \item It is sometimes split into specialist \textit{Narrow-AI} and Artificial General Intelligence \textit{(AGI)}.
        \item Almost all current 'AI' is Machine Learning.
