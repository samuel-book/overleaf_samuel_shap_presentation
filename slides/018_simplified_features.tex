\frametitle{Simplifying our model}

In order to simplify the model, to make it easier to explain, we reduced the number of patient features from 60 to 10, with almost no loss of model accuracy.

\small
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Arrival-to-scan time}: Time from arrival at hospital to scan (mins)
    \item \emph{Infarction}: Stroke type (infarction or haemorrhage)
    \item \emph{Stroke severity}: Stroke severity (NIHSS) on arrival (ranges from 0 to 42)
    \item \emph{Precise onset time}: Onset time is known precisely
    \item \emph{Prior disability level}: Disability level (modified Rankin Scale) before stroke
    \item \emph{Stroke team}: Stroke team attended
    \item \emph{Use of AF anticoagulants}: Use of atrial fibrillation anticoagulant
    \item \emph{Onset-to-arrival time}: Time from onset of stroke to arrival at hospital
    \item \emph{Onset during sleep}: Did stroke occur in sleep?
    \item \emph{Age}: Age (as middle of 5 year age bands)
\end{itemize}
