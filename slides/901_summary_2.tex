        \item Reduced 20+ fold with increasing arrival-to-scan time
        \item Varied 30 fold depending on stroke severity
        \item Reduced 3 fold with imprecise onset time (and another 4-fold if onset was during sleep)
        \item Fell 5 fold with increasing pre-stroke disability
        \item Varied 15 fold between hospitals.
        \item Fell 5 fold if the patient was taking anticoagulant medication
        \item Fell 3 fold between two and four hours arrival-to-onset time
    \end{itemize}

\item The hospital identification (hospital SHAP value) explained 58\% of the variance in between-hospital thrombolysis use.
