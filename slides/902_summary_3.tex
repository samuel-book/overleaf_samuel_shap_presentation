\begin{itemize}
    \item The decision model revealed that the odds of receiving was most influenced by:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Arrival-to-scan time; Stroke type; Stroke severity; Whether onset time was known precisely or was estimated; Pre-stroke disability; Stroke team; Use of anticoagulants for AF; Onset-to-arrival time
    \end{itemize}

\item The hospital identification (hospital SHAP value) explained 58\% of the variance in between-hospital thrombolysis use. Hospitals with lower thrombolysis use were particularly less likely to give thrombolysis to patients with milder strokes, prior disability, or patients with imprecise onset time.

\item The outcome revealed that outcome was most influenced by:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Prior disability; Stroke severity; Stroke team; Age; Scan-to-thrombolysis time
        \item Note: Whether stroke onset time was known precisely or was estimated influenced choice to use thrombolysis, but did not influence outcomes with/without thrombolysis.
    \end{itemize}
