\begin{itemize}
    \item Machine learning allows prediction of use of thrombolysis, tailored to both patient and hospital.
    \item Machine learning also allows for prediction of outcome for any patient with or without thrombolysis, allowing us to estimate the effectiveness of thrombolysis in practice (and breakdown by patient characteristics).
    \item Clinical pathway simulation allows us to predict the changes in the emergency stroke pathway, including differences in processes and clinical decision making.
