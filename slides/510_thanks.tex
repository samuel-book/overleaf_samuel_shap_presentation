    \item Our wonderful \textbf{Patient and Carer's Involvement team} (led by a former patient).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To misquote Albert Einstein: `\textit{If you can't explain it to a public and patient involvement team, you don't understand it'}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Our brilliant \textbf{qualitative research team} who are investigating how clinicians react to us using machine learning to analyse what they do differently (and how that affects outcomes).
    \item \textbf{Martin James}, who keeps asking difficult questions.
    \item \textbf{Anna Laws}, who has developed our web apps, while building mathematical models of outcomes, and writing clinical pathway simulation code.
    \item \textbf{Kerry Pearn}, who has developed our explainable machine learning work.
