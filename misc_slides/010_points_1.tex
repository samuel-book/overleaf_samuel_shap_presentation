    \item AI is a very general term
    \item Most AI is machine learning - which learns patterns in data
    \item Data (and labelling of that data) is critical; more critical than fine details of the machine learning method
    \item It's always worth exploring what data was used for training (will they even tell you?*)  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item *I'm looking at you Google (BARD) and OpenAI (ChatGPT)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Prediction does not imply causation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The machine learning world is just waking up to the science of causal inference
    \end{itemize}
    \item `Accuracy` always needs more investigating!
    \item Explainability is critical in health models
    \item Keeping people in the loop is really important, and will be for a long time yet.
\end{itemize}
