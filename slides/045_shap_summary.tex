    \item Reduced 20 fold over the first 100 minutes of arrival-to-scan time.
    \item Varied 30 fold depending on stroke severity.
    \item Reduced 3 fold with imprecise onset time.
    \item Fell 5 fold with increasing pre-stroke disability.
    \item Varied 15 fold between hospitals. 
    \item Fell 5 fold if the patient was taking anticoagulant medication.
    \item Was stable for the first two hours of arrival-to-onset time,and then fell 3 fold between two and four hours arrival-to-onset time
    \item Fell 2 fold between the age of 80 and 110.
    \item Fell 4 fold if onset was during sleep (these patients will also have the reduction due to imprecise onset time).
