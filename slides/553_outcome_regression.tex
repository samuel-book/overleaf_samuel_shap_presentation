Using SHAP to estimate the log-odds of improved outcome with thrombolysis allows us to replicate the clinical trials showing the effectiveness of thrombolsysis, and the decline in effectiveness over time.

The results show that the clinical effectiveness of thrombolysis in real life is as good as the clinical trials predicted (which some have doubted).
