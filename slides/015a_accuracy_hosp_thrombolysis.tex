\begin{frame}{Predicting hospital thrombolysis use across 132 hospitals}

\small
Predicted thrombolysis use (for patients arriving within 4 hours of known stroke onset) was measured by combining 5 test sets from k-fold validation (where the model is tested on data not used to train the model). The predicted vs. observed thrombolysis are highly correlated (r-squared 0.977).
