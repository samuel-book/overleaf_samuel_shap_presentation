\textbf{What are we trying to do? Working with the national stroke audit...}
\vspace{2mm}

\begin{itemize} 

\setlength{\itemsep}{1mm}

\item We are seeking to understand why thrombolysis rates vary so much between hospitals, and how that is affecting outcomes. 
    \vspace{1mm}
    \begin{itemize} 
    \item How much is due to differences in local populations, and how much is due to differences in hospital processes and decision-making?
    \end{itemize}

\item We are seeking to understand what is a realistic target for thrombolysis at each hospital, given a hospital's own patient population.

\item We are seeking to identify what are the key changes for any hospital to focus on to improve thrombolysis use and benefit:

    \begin{itemize}
    \vspace{1mm}
        \item Process speed
        \item Ascertainment of stroke onset times
        \item Choice of patients who receive thrombolysis
    \end{itemize}
        
\end{itemize}
