Predicted thrombolysis rates (of arrivals by ambulance) could potentially be improved from ~8\% to 15\% by focusing on 1) better ascertainment of \textit{stroke onset times}, and 2) applying \textit{thrombolysis decision making} used elsewhere.

\textbf{NOTE}: We do not consider a 20\% target suitable for this patient population.
