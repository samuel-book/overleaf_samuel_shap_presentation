\begin{itemize}
    \item Patient features alone explain 36\% of the variance in hospital thrombolysis use.
    \item Hospital features (hospital ID and arrival-to-scan time) alone explain 74\% of the variance in hospital thrombolysis use.
    \item Together, patient and hospital features explain 95\% of the variance in hospital thrombolysis use.
    \item Note: The sum of the patient-alone and hospital-one features = 110\%, suggesting we have a small amount of shared information between those groups.
\end{itemize}
