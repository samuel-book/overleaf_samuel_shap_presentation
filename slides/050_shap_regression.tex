\begin{itemize}
    \item Patient features (mean SHAP for each feature) alone explain 36\% of the variance in hospital thrombolysis use.
    \item Hospital features (men SHAP for hospital ID and arrival-to-scan time) alone explains 74\% of the variance in hospital thrombolysis use. Hospital ID alone explains 58\% of the variance and arrival-to-scan time explains 23\% of the variance.
    \item Together, patient and hospital features explain 95\% of the variance in hospital thrombolysis use.
    \item Note: The sum of the patient-alone and hospital-one features = 110\%, suggesting we have a small amount of shared information between those groups.
