\frametitle{Subgroup analysis}

We examine thrombolysis rate in subgroups of patients:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{All patients}: All patients arriving within 4 hours of known stroke onset.
    \item \emph{`Ideal' patients}: Patients with:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Stroke severity NIHSS in range 10-25, Arrival-to-scan time $<$ 20 minutes, Stroke type = infarction, Precise onset time = True, Prior disability level (mRS) = 0, No use of AF anticoagulants, Onset-to-arrival time $<$ 90 minutes, Age $<$ 80 years, Onset during sleep = False.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \emph{Mild stroke}: As \emph{all patients} but with NIHSS 1-5.
    \item \emph{No precise onset}: As \emph{all patients} but with onset labeled as \emph{not precisely known}.
    \item \emph{Pre-stroke disability}: As \emph{all patients} but with pre-stroke mRS $>$ 2.
    \item \emph{Age 80+}: As \emph{all patients} but ages 80+.
    
\end{itemize}
