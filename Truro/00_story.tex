    \item RCH has exemplary arrival-to-scan times.

            \item Scan-to-thrombolysis times are worse than national average.

    \item RCH has poorer-than-average determination of stroke onset times. 
    
    \begin{itemize}

        \item This is \textit{likely} to be reducing thrombolysis rates.

    \end{itemize}

    \item RCH has a lower-than-average use of thrombolysis for patients scanned in time for thrombolysis. This \textit{may} be causing worse outcomes (death or severe disability) at RCH.

        \item RCH is less likely than most stroke units to give thrombolysis to patients with imprecisely known onset time.

        \item RCH is less likely than most stroke units to give thrombolysis to patients with prior disability.
