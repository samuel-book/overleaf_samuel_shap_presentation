\begin{itemize}
    \item The XGBoost/SHAP model revealed that the odds of receiving thrombolysis:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reduced with increasing arrival-to-scan time.
        \item Varied 30 fold depending on stroke severity.
        \item Reduced with imprecisely known onset time.
        \item Fell with increasing pre-stroke disability.
        \item Varied 15 fold between hospitals. 
    \end{itemize}

\item The hospital identification (hospital SHAP value) explained 58\% of the variance in between-hospital thrombolysis use. 

\item Compared with hospitals with higher thrombolysis use, hospitals with lower use were particularly less likely to give thrombolysis to patients with milder strokes, prior disability, or patients with imprecise onset time.
\end{itemize}
