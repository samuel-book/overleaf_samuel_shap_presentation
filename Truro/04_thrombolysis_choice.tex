\frametitle{\large{How does RCH differ in \textit{choice} of thrombolysis to other units?}}

\small
Like other units, RCH would thrombolyse 9/10 of 'near-ideal' thrombolysis candidates (NIHSS 15, no prior disability, age 70-75, precisely known onset time). RCH is very \textit{normal} in treating these patients.
