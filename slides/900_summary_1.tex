\begin{itemize}
    \item The XGBoost/SHAP model revealed that the odds of receiving thrombolysis:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \scriptsize
        \item Reduced 20 fold over the first 100 minutes of arrival-to-scan time.
        \item Varied 30 fold depending on stroke severity.
        \item Reduced 3 fold with imprecise onset time.
        \item Fell 5 fold with increasing pre-stroke disability.
        \item Varied 15 fold between hospitals. 
        \item Fell 5 fold if the patient was taking anticoagulant medication.
        \item Was stable for the first two hours of arrival-to-onset time, and then fell 3 fold between two and four hours arrival-to-onset time
        \item Fell 2 fold between the age of 80 and 110.
        \item Fell 4 fold if onset was during sleep (these patients will also have the reduction due to imprecise onset time). 
    \end{itemize}

\small
\item The hospital identification (hospital SHAP value) explained 58\% of the variance in between-hospital thrombolysis use. 

\item Compared with hospitals with higher thrombolysis use, hospitals with lower use were particularly less likely to give thrombolysis to patients with milder strokes, prior disability, or patients with imprecise onset time.
\end{itemize}
