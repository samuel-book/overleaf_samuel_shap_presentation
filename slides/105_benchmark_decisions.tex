\frametitle{What if all decisions were made by the majority vote of 30 benchmark hospitals?}

\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
    \item The hospitals with the highest predicted thrombolysis rate in a 10k patient cohort were taken as \emph{benchmark hospitals}. 
    \item For each hospital we predicted the benchmark hospital decisions for all patients, and took a majority vote of the benchmark decisions.
    \item If majority benchmark decisions were made, thrombolysis use would increase 31\% at non-benchmark hospitals.
\end{itemize}
