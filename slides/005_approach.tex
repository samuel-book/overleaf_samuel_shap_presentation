\small

\begin{itemize}
    \item Train a machine learning algorithm to learn to predict which patients would receive thrombolysis at each hospital. %\pause
    \item Identify the patient characteristics which are most important in predicting use of thrombolysis, and produce a simpler machine learning model based on these characteristics. %\pause
    \item Add an \emph{explainable machine learning} layer to understand patterns of use of thrombolysis.
    \begin{itemize}
        \footnotesize
        \item We use SHAP (Shapley Additive Values), which provide information on what contribution each patient characteristic makes to the final prediction of whether they will, or will not, receive thrombolysis. %\pause
    \end{itemize}
    \item Investigate what we think would happen if every hospital received exactly the same 10k cohort of patients. %\pause
    \item Identify key subgroups of patients where hospitals differ in their use of thrombolysis.
\end{itemize}
